        	<h2>Flame and Frost</h2>
            <h3>New Friends, New Enemies</h3>
                <p>
                    I was asked to meet with Rytlock at the Black Citadel—walked right into a full-on war council. There've been attacks all over the southern Shiverpeaks, dredge and Flame Legion working together. They're calling themselves the "Molten Alliance," and the casualties are starting to stack up.

                    On my way inside, I ran into Rytlock consulting with a charr named Rox. She's trying out for his warband, so Rytlock's putting her through her paces. He ordered her to retake the recently captured North Nolan Hatchery from the Alliance. I volunteered to tag along, see if I can get a better grasp of the situation.

                    I went straight to Rytlock's office after the quorum. If the stakes weren't high enough, Rytlock was already at odds with another unfamiliar face: Braham Eirsson. His village was being threatened by the Molten Alliance. Rytlock rejected his request, despite their desperate need for reinforcements. The Legions are overwhelmed and Smodur can't spare the troops. Braham claimed to be Eir Stegalkin's son in an attempt to curry our favor, but it didn't work on Rytlock or me. Hopefully he'll get some better news after speaking to Knut Whitebear.

                    The air was already thick with smoke by the time Rox and I arrived at the hatchery. The Alliance was using some sort of sonic emitters to incapacitate the devourers—the sound was miserable. Fortunately with a couple good whacks, they were out of commission. But if that was just a taste of the weapons they're fusing... The dredge and Flame Legion are going to be a far more destructive team than we imagined.

                    After we destroyed the emitters and rescued Sithio Quicklash, Sithio gave us a key to travel further into the facility. We put down one of the Alliance leaders inside, a dredge named Marat. With Marat down the attack was quelled and we were able to reclaim the hatchery. Though the reason for these attacks is still foggy, we do know that they

                    Molten Alliance is taking prisoners... Where and for what purpose? That's for us to find out.

                    In lighter news, Rox found a new friend. One of the lone devourers at the hatchery started following her like a lost puppy. She tried to shoo it away, but an ally is an ally. Rox gave in and let the little guy tag along. A small moment of reprieve on an otherwise difficult day. 
                </p>
            <h3>The Battle for Cragstead</h3>
                <p>
                    Rytlock asked me to check in on the Cragstead situation. When I arrived in Hoelbrak to meet Braham, I walked in on a pretty...colorful chat between him, Knut, and Eir. And here I thought a war council of battle-hungry Tribunes was intimidating.

                    The Molten Alliance has been striking small villages throughout the Shiverpeaks—including Cragstead, Braham's home. Even though a raid was imminent, Knut was reluctant to send any reinforcements. They've got enough of a refugee crisis on their doorstep, same as the charr in the Citadel. Given the way things escalated at the hatchery, I volunteered to join Braham in fighting back.

                    Out losses at Cragstead were brutal. We managed to rescue some of the homesteaders, but a few of them were taken prisoner, including Ottilia, an ex-fling of Braham's. We don't know where they were taken yet, but finding their base is next on our list, and the Vigil is hot on their trail.

                    I didn't know Eir had a kid, let alone one as...hardheaded as Braham. His head may be full of steam, but he's got guts if he's willing to stand up to the Master of the Lodge. Reinforcements or not, he ran right into Cragstead, shield raised.

            <h3>Alliance Investigation</h3>
                <p>
                    Agent Brandubh, a representative from the Order of Whispers, called on me to help with their recon operation in Diessa Plateau. The countryside is currently littered with Molten Alliance attacks—villages raided, homesteaders and charr being taken left and right. The Orders are working tirelessly to tame the chaos, but the Molten Alliance grows stronger by the hour.

                    The Order of Whispers partnered with the Vigil to locate the Molten Alliance's base of operations. Brandubh's partner is currently undercover as Flame Legion, gathering intel on their goals and whereabouts. She's been leaving dead drops all over the countryside with vital information, ready for us to decode. The intel was scattered about the countryside, but Brandubh had a rough idea about where the messages are tucked away. The information they contained would have been deadly in the wrong hands.

                    With the dead drops in hand, the Order was able to determine the location of the Molten Alliance base. They've been operating out of an old dredge mine right beneath our feet. We're getting a small strike group together to get the prisoners out, maybe see what else we can learn inside.

            <h3>Molten Furnace</h3>
                <p>
                        With the help of the Vigil and Order of Whispers, Braham, Rox, and I infiltrated the Molten Alliance base. The things they're doing down there, the weapons that the Alliance is building...

                        We fought our way to the weapons-testing facility first. They tried to trap us inside of the main arena, subjecting us to their "games." Flaming walls, traps, explosions—to think that they made some of the prisoners endure those tests. Well, there's not much left of the lab anymore. Kostya, one of the Alliance's leading scientists, tried to stop us, but I don't think anyone was in the mood to talk things out.

                        After destroying their weapons-testing area, we made our way deeper into the mine. We encountered a few survivors along the way. Braham... I could tell his stress was building. Finding some of his friends from Cragstead gave him a flicker of hope, but there were still more prisoners deeper in the mine. The smell of burnt flesh didn't instill a ton of confidence.

                        As we made our way into the heart of the base, we found some sort of weapon fixed in the center of the main chamber. The size of that thing...it was enormous. We didn't have a lot of time to inspect the device before we were ambushed by two more Molten Alliance warriors: Rodion and Gigarg.

                        They looked like they were dropped straight out of the test lab. Blue flame pulsed through Rodion's veins—I've never seen a charr that big. Gigarg's armor was just as impressive. There was something eerie about them. Their size, their strength...There's nothing natural about it. We took them down, but we almost went down with them.

                        After the fight, Braham and I planted bombs along the base of the mystery weapon while Rox secured our exit. Rox was reluctant to handle explosives, but that's a story for less dire circumstances. We escaped by the skin of our teeth, but at least we left behind a mess. Whatever that weapon was, I hope it stays buried along with the rest of the facility.

                        The Molten Alliance is done. At least for now.
