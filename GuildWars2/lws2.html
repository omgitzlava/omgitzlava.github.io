            <center><span id="Disturbance in Brisban Wildlands" class="year">1327 AE:</span><span class ="chapter"> Disturbance in Brisban Wildlands</span></center>
                <p>
                    I received another note from the cryptic "E" asking me to investigate mysterious incursions at the edge of Brisban Wildlands, while suggesting that these incursions may be an early sign that a new threat to Tyria was in fact roused during Scarlet Briar's attack on Lion's Arch.
                    <br>
                    I joined Marjory, Kasmeer, Braham, Rox, and Taimi at the Seraph outpost in Tangle Root, and worked with the Seraph to defeat the hostile Inquest krewe that was harassing them. We fought in areas that are being choked with gigantic, thorny vines. This merited further investigation.
                    <br>
                    Taimi seemed to be clashing with Rox over little things. She's a smart kid who means well; we just have to remember she's a child. She
                    talks about Braham like he's her big brother, which is probably good considering her situation. Braham's leg seems to have healed since the Scarlet fight. 
                </p>
            <center><span id="Fallen Hopes" class="year">1327 AE:</span><span class ="chapter"> Fallen Hopes</span></center>
                <p>
                    Marjory, Kasmeer, and I investigated the Zephyrite airship crash in Dry Top. Wreckage and bodies were strewn about the canyon, making it difficult to piece together the sequence of events. We learned of a Soundless sylvari named Aerin who attacked the ship's crew and set off the explosives that ultimately took down the aircraft. We have reason to believe this murderous saboteur is after the Master of Peace, who has been missing. I should head to the nearby mining town, Prosperity, to see if he's there.
                    <br>
                    Kasmeer worried that Marjory still hadn't healed from the fight against Scarlet, but her fears were put to rest after Marjory held her own in our repeated fights against the Inquest operatives at the crash site.
                </p>
            <center><span id="Tracking the Master of Peace" class="year">1327 AE:</span><span class ="chapter"> Tracking the Master of Peace</span></center>
                <p>
                    I headed to Prosperity to find clues that would point me toward the Master of Peace. Once there, I found the body of a poor merchant who presumably was killed by the saboteur. It's possible that the merchant had sold the Master of Peace some supplies, and the saboteur demanded information. We'll probably never know.
                    <br>
                    I found a frightened woman inside the mine who witnessed the murder. She said the killer was chasing the Master of Peace, and that I should head toward Spurbend Canyon. I read the torn pages from Aerin's defaced copy of a Zephyrite manuscript, and followed the trail to the top of a ridge where I will meet my friends.
                </p>
            <center><span id="Cornered" class="year">1327 AE:</span><span class ="chapter"> Cornered</span></center>
                <p>
                   I rejoined Marjory, Kasmeer, Braham, Rox, and Taimi to search for the Master of Peace before the saboteur, Aerin, could catch him. We found Aerin and pursued him deep into the canyon. Aerin's behavior was manic, almost like Scarlet's during her final days. He fought fiercely, but ultimately lost. The Master of Peace said that Aerin wanted great power but was refused. He didn't explain what that meant, nor did he say where he was headed next. His backpack was loaded with something—probably supplies. He may be embarking on a long journey.
                    <br>                  
                    I searched Aerin's corpse. He was carrying a note with frantic scrawlings that said a "leader will die" and that "the rest will fall in line." Did he mean the Master of Peace or someone else? I also found some animal hairs on Aerin's corpse that probably came from livestock back in Prosperity. We should return there and continue our investigation.                    
                </p>
            <center><span id="Prosperity's Mystery" class="year">1327 AE:</span><span class ="chapter"> Prosperity's Mystery</span></center>
                <p>
                    Townspeople in Prosperity revealed that a strange (and dangerous) sylvari kept a room there. No one has dared go in, even though the sylvari hasn't been seen for years. We suspect it was Scarlet.
                    <br>
                    I asked the people of Prosperity about Aerin but instead learned that Scarlet rented a room in town. It was full of her belongings. I've never seen Taimi so excited. She left behind a holographic journal that chronicled her transformation from a lab assistant named Ceara to the Scarlet that was universally loathed. Other artifacts were scattered about the room, including a strange drawing of the Pale Tree.
                    <br>
                    Scarlet was researching magical energy here and seemed to have found something significant near where the miners were digging. A local miner named Toska may know more about this.
                    <br>
                    Taimi found reference to a norn miner named Toska who was among those who first broke through to the ley line chamber. I located Toska nearby. She said the mine mysteriously caved in, but she thought that Scarlet may have found another way in.

            <center><span id="Scarlet's Secret Room" class="year">1327 AE:</span><span class ="chapter"> Scarlet's Secret Room</span></center>
                <p>
                    After Braham notified me of an attack on the Dry Top town of Prosperity, I headed out there to check on Taimi.
                    <br>
                    We found that Taimi was okay, despite the horrible destruction of Prosperity. The upheaval caused by the vines, however, revealed a secret passage behind Scarlet's bookcase. In the tunnels under her room, I found a map tracing her route to some unknown destination to the southwest.
                </p> 
            
            <center><span id="Discovering Scarlet's Breakthrough" class="year">1327 AE:</span><span class ="chapter"> Discovering Scarlet's Breakthrough</span></center>
                <p>
                    Finding the secret passage out of Scarlet's former home in Prosperity was only the beginning of a new search to discover the truth of what Scarlet was after in Dry Top. I retraced her route across the Uplands to a place that the Maguuma centaurs called the Cavern of Shining Lights, and along the way I found components of her arcane machinery and a few of her broken-down steam minions.
                </p>
            <center><span id="The Concordia Incident" class="year">1327 AE:</span><span class ="chapter"> The Concordia Incident</span></center>
                <p>
                    While Taimi continued her research at the ley line hub, Rox, Braham, and I investigated the waypoint disruption at Concordia. We found the fort ravaged by jungle tendrils and other creatures. I led the search party that rescued Lindsay and some of her colleagues before fending off the remaining attackers at Goldenlight Hallow lab. Tactician Art mentioned that the vines started sprouting from the ground shortly after a shipment of magical artifacts arrived. I'm not sure of the connection there.
                    <br>
                    Rox made an offhand comment about Taimi. I think the kid is getting on her nerves.
                </p>
            <center><span id="Trouble at Fort Salma" class="year">1327 AE:</span><span class ="chapter"> Trouble at Fort Salma</span></center>
                <p>
                    I fought my way into Fort Salma to fend off a monstrous Mordrem thrasher alongside Marjory and Kasmeer, only to discover that we were too late to save Belinda. Marjory will return home to bury her fallen sister, while Kasmeer and I will head back to Dry Top to rejoin our friends.
                    <br>
                    I could tell Kasmeer was upset that Marjory is leaving her behind while she takes care of funeral arrangements for her sister. The relentless fighting and sudden loss is taking its toll on their relationship.                 
                </p>
            <center><span id="The Machine" class="year">1327 AE:</span><span class ="chapter"> The Machine</span></center>
                <p>
                    In Scarlet's one-time lab at the ley line hub beneath Dry Top, Taimi started developing a device to recalibrate the waypoints so as not to attract Mordrem. She'd also discovered Omadd's machine, the device that Scarlet used to see the Eternal Alchemy. I unwittingly entered the device and experienced my own cosmic vision—one that included the Pale Tree and a handful of mysterious orbs representing Elder Dragons. I need to speak with the Pale Tree to learn more.
